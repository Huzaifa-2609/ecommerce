# MERN Ecommerce Project

This is a full-stack ecommerce project built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It provides a foundation for building an online store with features like product listing, user authentication, shopping cart functionality, and order processing.

## Features

- User authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out. Authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure and stateless communication.
- Product listing: Products are stored in a MongoDB database and can be viewed and searched on the frontend.
- Product details: Users can view detailed information about each product, including price, description, and images.
- Shopping cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart and update the quantities or remove items.
- Checkout process: Users can proceed to the checkout process, enter shipping and payment details, and place orders.
- Order management: Admin users have access to an admin panel where they can manage orders, mark them as shipped, and view order details.
- User profiles: Users can view and edit their profile information, including shipping addresses and payment methods.
